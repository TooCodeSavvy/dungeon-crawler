## üîê Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **Git** (v2.30+)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) - [Install guide](https://cli.github.com/)
- **Composer** - [Install guide](https://getcomposer.org/)
- **PHP** (8.2+)
- **Git Flow** (optional, script will install)

### Setup GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install (macOS)
brew install gh

# Install (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Always run from project root**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/dungeon-crawler
   ./scripts/script-name.sh
   ```

2. **Check script requirements**
    - Some scripts need GitHub CLI authentication
    - Some modify git configuration
    - Some require clean working directory

3. **Use dev-workflow.sh for daily tasks**
    - It handles branching conventions
    - Ensures consistent workflow
    - Reduces manual git commands

4. **Run project-status.sh before meetings**
    - Quick project health check
    - Identifies blockers
    - Shows progress metrics

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### GitHub CLI Not Authenticated
```bash
gh auth status  # Check status
gh auth login   # Re-authenticate
```

### Script Fails on Windows
Use Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run bash scripts.

### Git Flow Commands Not Found
```bash
# The setup script should install it, but manually:
brew install git-flow        # macOS
apt-get install git-flow     # Ubuntu/Debian
```
